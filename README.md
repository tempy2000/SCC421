# SCC421
The main repository for SCC 421. This will contain code and links to request access to the other repositories.

University Email: m.templeton@lancaster.ac.uk
Secondary Email: matthewadamtempleton@gmail.com

To request access, please email me with either your GitHub email, or your GitHub username. If neither are provided, I will provide access to the email used to send the request. I will only be accepting those in the Lancaster University directory, between the date of submission, and the data of moderation/graduation.

Thanks!
